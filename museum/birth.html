              <p>John Thomas Bigge was commissioned by Lord Bathurst, Secretary for War and the Colonies, to investigate the state of the penal system in New South Wales. In his report was the first ever mention of Moreton Bay as a possible settlement. Bigge identified three possible locations for a new penal settlement: Port Bowen, Port Curtis and Moreton Bay. He projected the costs for establishing and running these new settlements, and wrote a long list of rules and regulations for their operation. Upon his appointment as Governor of New South Wales, Sir Thomas Brisbane implemented the findings of this report.</p>

I was struck with amazement and horror at the cruelty and hardships every poor unfortunate sufferer like myself, appeared to have been subject to for a length of time. Their countenances bespoke starvation, and their bodies bore marks, evidently of most severe flogging...I was sent to work in the fields in breaking up hard ground, and the task that was measured out to me daily, was more than the strength of my body could perform. I was therefore exposed to the will of a cruel overseer, who was invested with full power to bring me before the Commandant, who without asking him a second question, would not hesitate to award me one hundred lashes, and repeat the same punishment day after day...</span>

            <p>It was a condition of sentence that convicts be chained for a period of time, sometimes for their full seven-year sentence. The leg-irons were made by a convict blacksmith in the lumber yard, and fastened with a rivet that had to be cut out with a chisel when removed. Members of the chain-gangs worked in the farms and on the treadmill. The better class of convicts were not put
                in leg-irons and worked in more specialised trades as carpenters, cabinet makers and wheelwrights. They also made clothes, soap, candles and other items for the settlement.  -
