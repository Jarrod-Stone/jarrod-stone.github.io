            After witnessing a wall of water so great that as it crashed through his property it made the house shake, a farmer sent a message to Brisbane — prepare to flood! Brisbane was accustomed to floods, an inevitable outcome for a town built on the banks of a large river.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he named the Brisbane River in 1823 John Oxley reported that it showed no signs of past floods. Only one year later he would see evidence to the contrary. Since then, Brisbane has experienced several major flood events, with three that have significantly impacted the city and the daily lives of its residents: 1893, 1974 and 2011. Each of these floods provided dramatic scenes and left a lasting impact and, consequently, each of these floods led to the introduction of new measures to prevent it from happening again. Somerset Dam, named after the farmer who sent the telegram warning of the 1893 flood, was completed in 1959 and Wivenhoe Dam was built in 1984.
          </p>
          <p>
            It had been 81 years since the river had flooded to the extent that it did on Australia Day in 1974. Few residents were alive that had experienced the devastating floods of 1893, yet many would have been familiar with stories of the damage it caused. Houses in West End were swept off their stumps and carried by the floodwaters until they piled up against the Victoria Bridge, which eventually succumbed to the pressure and collapsed.
          </p>
          <p>
            With mobile phones and television cameras capturing moment after moment, the extent of the 2011 flood will live long in the city’s memory. For those flooded, a long period of sustained rain is unnerving. They know the high cost of a flood, be it financial, the loss of personal possessions that can never be replaced or the emotional struggles that linger.

          <p><strong>“Such were the effects of this disaster that I and many another child of the period grew up with the Brisbane and the biblical floods thoroughly mixed up. We sensed some terrible happening in the past which was affecting our entire existence but we couldn’t exactly place. Adult conversation was pitted with references to it; events of the past — and the past to a child of six is an eternity — occurred either ‘before the flood’ or ‘after the flood’. And so the biblical flood and ‘the 93’ (as it was called) ran together in my mind, a sort of looming and inescapable presence.”</strong> Lloyd Rees, Brisbane artist, 1969</p><br><br>

          Few items survive a flood to become historical records of the event. And while photographs and footage present familiar scenes and provide an accurate documentation of a moment in time, it is artistic responses that often convey a bigger story. Artworks can capture a particular mood or express an emotion, or in the case of Watts’ painting, present a summary narrative of events. Watts depicted the impact of the past through the collapsed bridge, while the impact on residents is represented by the ferry, which would remain the only means to cross the river for the immediate future. The bridge wasn’t replaced until 1895.

        <p><strong>“That bridge [Victoria Bridge] was swept away in the ’93 flood. I saw it before and just after it had broken. A great mass of logs and debris formed against the bridge on the upper stream side. It was like a great raft from one side of the river to the other, and 30 or 40 yards wide up the river. The great mass of the flood proved too much for the bridge and it gave way … But interesting as was the flood a more important event occurred that year. 1893. After life became normal again I began the study of music.” </strong> - Pecry Brier, Brisbane musician, 1950</p>

        <p>The loss of the Victoria Bridge was the most dramatic moment in Brisbane’s most destructive flood. A town of predominantly timber homes could not handle the volume of water inundating the low lying suburbs. Parts of South Brisbane, in what is West End today, had block after block of houses swept off their stumps. Low lying suburbs became inland seas with corrugated islands, while the Government gunboat Paluma and two steamers became stranded in front of the bunya pines in the Botanic Gardens. The three floods in early 1893 had a lasting impact on the psyche of the city and were commemorated in a set of 81 matted photographs, presented in a leather bound album. The same photographs were also printed at a smaller size and reproduced in a paper booklet available as a supplement in The Moreton Bay Courier.</p>

        <p><strong>“In 1931, some 40 years later, Brisbane had another massive flood and farmland on the Brisbane River near Oxley went under. By 1974 (yes, another 40 years or thereabouts) that farmland had become the new and expensive suburb of Jindalee, it went under. Town planners had seen the 1931 figures but they reckoned such flooding was abnormal. Abnormal but curiously regular.”</strong> - Thomas Shapcott, Queensland poet and novelist, 2011 </p>

        <p>While reconstruction was required after the destructive floods of 1893, the modern city dealt with the inundation of 1974 and 2011 more robustly and the focus of the community was applied to the cleanup. During the 2011 flood more than 55,000 people registered to assist with the clean-up along with countless others who went to the aid of family, friends and strangers. The ‘mud army’ played a significant role in the first steps of Brisbane’s recovery from the flood, but also in lifting the spirits of those directly impacted by the flood waters.

I was more emotional when the water had gone down and there was a realisation of what was gone and couldn’t be saved started to sink in. And you realise all the photographs you should have taken with you, the slides, the books.”</strong> - Malcolm Vickers, Brisbane resident, 1999</p>

        <p>Experiences of floods are diverse, and for some, having an outlet to express emotions became a vital tool for moving on after the event. These expressions also provide a valuable record of the emotional cost, far beyond the estimated $400 billion damage bill of the 2011 flood.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his flood damaged house after the 2011 flood, Jai Sparks of The Strums wrote a song in response to the situation in which he found himself. Oh River conveys the transition of feelings from hope to uncertainty as the floodwaters rose and claimed more than his home.</p>
        <p>For Cassie Woolley, who jumped in her car and drove from her home in Windaroo to Fairfield just to help, the experience of trawling through a strangers muddy house was overwhelming. Cassie sat down that evening and wrote about her experiences of the day spent helping a complete stranger.</p>
        <p>The loss of her house and all her possessions was a traumatising experience for Marjorie Cross. A series of community art projects generated new friendships and played a significant role in finding a way to deal with the emotions still lingering from the impact of the flood.</p>

Studies have revealed that anxiety, irritability, sleeplessness and depression increase after natural disasters.</p> 
        <p>The Brisbane River flood of January 2011 was part of a much larger flood event that impacted Queensland. 35 people lost their lives in this flood event. This added to the deaths known to have been a result of the previous major floods in Brisbane’s history, when 35 people died in 1893 and 17 in 1974.</p>

Dramatic footage of cars being swept along by a torrent of water in Toowoomba and the tragic news of a rising death toll were seen by the residents of Brisbane, preparing for the Brisbane River to peak the following day. Those whose homes were not in danger captured the slowly rising muddy water on mobile phones and watched the television coverage, leaving an indelible memory that will last a lifetime. More than 5% of Brisbane was flood-affected.</p>
