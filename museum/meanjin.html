          <p>“...it must be recollected that the European having seized to himself the lands of the aborigines, the least return he can make is to bestow on them the benefits of that civilisation which is the white man’s proudest boast, and which has been the means of enabling him to render subservient to his power and will his sable brethren whenever he has found them.  Now, amongst those benefits should be the repression of the meaningless feuds that frequently terminate in such murderous scenes as the one which we have described.” - The Illustrated London News 17/6 1854</p>

              <p>Dundalli belonged to the Dala clan of the Jinibara tribal group in what is today the Stanley River catchment in the hinterland of the Sunshine Coast.  During the first years following the closure of the penal settlement in 1839, he became the figurehead of the resistance to the European’s settlement of the area around Brisbane.  He was respected by the various Aboriginal groups in the Brisbane region, and feared by the Europeans.</p>

            <p>Instructed in traditional law, where payback -  avenging an injury - was an essential part of justice, he initially attempted to engage the new arrivals in the proper way of behaving on Aboriginal lands.  However, following the mass poisoning of Aboriginal people on Kilcoy Station, where between 30 and 60 men, women and children died after eating flour laced with arsenic, other warriors began to avenge these deaths.  Dundalli’s social responsibilities and duty to uphold his laws and values drew him into a series of events that would see him hunted for over ten years.</p>

            <p>As a senior man and warrior of his group, Dundalli was involved in arranging and enacting hostile acts in accordance to traditional law, as well as the training of younger warriors. Following the murder of Andrew Gregor and Mary Shannon on a property near Caboolture, Dundalli became a key Aboriginal figure wanted in relation to these acts. He was eventually captured in May 1854, while clearing trees for a brick maker in Fortitude Valley. Despite being a respected lawman, he was unable to speak in his own defence within the British legal system.</p>

              <p>Dundalli was found guilty and hanged on 5 January 1855. While waiting at the gallows he called in his language to the crowd of Aboriginal people gathered on the hill overlooking the gaol:</p>

            <p>Even at the end, Dundalli's message related to the upholding of Aboriginal law; as his last words were for his political allies, telling them to avenge his death by killing the two Aboriginal men who had betrayed him to the police.</p>

              <p>Few cultural items belonging to the Aboriginal people that lived around the Brisbane River in the 1800s have survived. This shield, or 'kuntan', is made from a softwood tree that grew on the edge of mountain scrubs and near swamps. When dry they were very light, but tough, making them ideal to deflect spears. It is representative of those used by local Aboriginal men in the organised fights that were part of their system of law and governance. An illustration of one such fight was published in The Illustrated London News in 1854. The event took place near Burnett's Swamp, located along Norman Creek roughly where today's Cornwall Street and Juliette Street are in the suburb of Greenslopes. The report of the fight provides an insight into the attitudes of the new arrivals towards the Aboriginal people of the area. It acknowledges that their land had been taken without payment, but denies that this organised event was a considered element of a judicial system. - The Illustrated London News Affray of Aboriginal tribes, three miles from Brisbane, New South Wales 1854</p>
