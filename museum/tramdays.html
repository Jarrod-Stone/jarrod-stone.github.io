            For nearly 80 years trams were the main way to traverse the city, playing an important role in getting to and from work, going shopping, attending events, visiting friends and accessing places to relax. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The tram era is fondly remembered as one that offered an alternative to the carcentric culture we have today, with their peculiar features now celebrated as an important part of the city’s history. With gongs clanging they struggled up our steep hills, assisted by sand dropped in front and behind the wheels to provide better traction. Motormen twirled brake handles as passengers were jam-packed across benches, while conductors, in their foreign legion caps, balanced on the narrow running boards as they bounced around sharp bends. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The tramway network also played a significant role in the development of Brisbane, as the expansion of the network went hand-in-hand with the increased urbanisation of the city. Originally operated by a private company, the Brisbane Tramway Company, Councils and Shires lobbied the company for line extensions into their areas. They offered financial inducements to have new routes added to service their residents, because these would provide the impetus for the development of new houses, punctuated by shops, that paralleled the iron tracks. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The rise in popularity and affordability of cars placed pressure on the capacity of the streets to accommodate Brisbane’s rapidly growing population, while suburban sprawl exceeded the reach of the tram network. Brisbane City Council, who had taken over the network, commissioned and enacted a transportation report by Wilbur Smith and Associates that recommended “the scrapping of the trams.” The last tram ran in 1969 and many of the tracks were simply covered by new bitumen rather than being removed.

            <strong>“I drove the first electric tramcar that ran in Brisbane. The late Mr JS Badger… was the instructor in driving, and took the handles for the first part of the journey from the depot in Logan Road to the southern end of Victoria Bridge…Near the Clarence Corner we had a narrow escape from running a man down. Mr Badger was driving at the time, and naturally expected the man to get out of the way, for we were not travelling very fast. But the silly fellow kept on. You see, he wasn’t used to horse-less vehicles, and he thought that the car was going the other way. My word, he had a narrow shave, and it quite upset Mr Badger, who was shaking after it. He said to us, You know, I’m an electrician and not a driver; I’m not used to traffic.”</strong><br>John Atkinson, tram driver for Brisbane Tramway Company The Telegraph, 4 February 1937<br><br>

          Joseph Badger was an American employed by General Electric to oversee the introduction of Brisbane’s electric tramway system. Not long after his arrival in 1896, he was appointed by the Brisbane Tramway Company as General Manager, a position he held until he oversaw the sale of the company to the Queensland Government in 1922. Badger was first and foremost a company man. His ambition was to create a world-class tramway network, but his duty was to ensure shareholders received dividends from their investments. He set the fares and determined the number of services on a particular route. He decided where the trams would or wouldn’t run, with major expansions always on the company’s terms. Councils and Shires petitioned and offered financial incentives for routes to be extended to service their residents and businesses, and for the financial benefits they usually provided through increased property value and rates.

        <p>Brisbane experienced an unprecedented conflict played out on its streets early in 1912. It was a conflict between workers and management of the Brisbane Tramway Company, regarding the right to belong to a union. The rules of the Brisbane Tramway Company, published on 1 May 1911, prohibited the wearing of a badge of any kind on the tramway uniform. In January 1912, a shipment of badges of the Australian Tramway Employee Association were received from Melbourne and secretly distributed among the workers. In defiance of the company’s rule, employees belonging to the union arrived at work wearing their badge. Those that did were suspended and it was reported that two-thirds of the company’s employees were locked out that day.</p>

        <p><strong>“Then came the time when the other unions went out in sympathy with the Tramway men. All I remember is all the friends where I was staying being out of work. Food prices rose and milk reached the record of sixpence a pint. At school, fights amongst the children became more frequent and I well remember getting a hiding myself…Then came Black Friday (Black Friday was often spoken as Bad and Baton Friday) we were kept home from school that day... The Strikers had raided the Trades Hall, all the Police were called in. In almost every corner and parks fighting was going on. Police were using their batons. Special Constables were pulled off their horses tied to their tails and dragged along the streets.”</strong> SD Stephens, Brisbane resident during 1912 strike</p>

        <p>Following a meeting at Trades Hall, delegates from Brisbane’s 43 unions formed a strike committee in support of the suspended tramway workers. They decided that unless a satisfactory settlement was reached between employees and the Brisbane Tramway Company then a city-wide stop work would begin. It is estimated that 20,000 workers joined the strike, almost paralysing the city. Strikers formed mobs, hassled shop owners and verbally attacked the non-striking employees and new recruits, calling them ‘scabs’ and ‘blacklegs’. </p>

        <p>Once the general strike began on 30 January the strike committee organised around 500 vigilance officers to enforce an order for a stop-work on businesses within the city, unless the business had been granted a permit. Police were called upon to protect businesses and there were occasional clashes between the police and the strikers. A shot was fired through the window of Police Commissioner Cahill’s office in the Treasury building. The Police Commissioner’s office was located in the Treasury Building, in the alcove just below the level of the footpath, visible behind the group of female unionists marching towards the Victoria Bridge. </p>

        <p>Frank Edmonds was one of about 3,000 special constables that formed a civilian militia raised by the State Government. After being quickly trained by the police he was issued with this arm band and baton then deployed to protect local businesses, food deliveries to the city and the few tram services still running.</p>
        <p>The strikers and police violently clashed on Friday 2 February when a gathering of 15,000 strikers were charged by 2,000 armed police and special constables, resulting in a short but bloody battle, as depicted in this postcard. The day was quickly branded ‘Black Friday’. Having begun on 18 January following the lock out of tramway workers the strike came to an end on 6 March. The Brisbane Tramway employees who went on strike were allowed to return to work, and they could wear their union badge. </p>
